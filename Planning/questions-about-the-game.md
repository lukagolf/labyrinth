1. In the case that no players move during a round, the game ends, who is the winner?  
2. What happens if a tile where a player is located is pushed off the board for the step 1 of the move process?  
3. Let's suppose that the player sits on a tile that is somewhere in the middle of its tresure and home and where all three are connected. Can the player acquire the tresure and go back home in one move?
